### WeatherHub: Advanced Weather & Comparison Dashboard ###

WeatherHub is a comprehensive weather application built with **Python** and **Streamlit**. It provides real-time weather data, 24-hour forecasts with interactive charts, and a 7-day detailed outlook. A key feature is the ability to compare weather conditions between two different cities side-by-side.


In this project, I developed a modern and user-friendly web interface using Streamlit. As a 2nd-year Statistics student at Ankara University, I focused on transforming complex weather data into clear, interactive visualizations. The dashboard allows users to compare real-time conditions between cities and analyze 24-hour temperature trends through dynamic charts."

# Features
- **Real-time Data:** Fetches current temperature, "feels like" conditions, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Comparison Mode:** Select two cities to compare their weather metrics and temperature trends.
- **Interactive Charts:** Visualizes 24-hour temperature changes using line charts.
- **Dynamic Icons:** Custom emojis based on weather conditions (Sunny, Rainy, etc.).
- **7-Day Forecast:** Detailed daily summary including rain probability and high/low temperatures.
